<p align="center"> Yaupon is another symptom of the software development industry
where lazy incompetent people trying to avoid their boring work,
today's 'boilerplate'
is something
that few years ago we were complete product
that was sold to customers
—
we archived incredibly quick growth in my last
years in the industry.
Looking at this trend,
Here is mine brick too: <code>@shadcn/ui</code> for back-end appplications
and this in my mind is the one of potential way to pour some additional release to the industry
(sorry for saying this for the software written in JavaScript, but you get the concept; Once I'll get 
a bit better at Rust there will be "The Grand Rewrite"). I mean I got kinda tilted on integrating IAM
3-4 times like... this is fucking boring.
